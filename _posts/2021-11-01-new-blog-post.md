## Why Data Science

My path to data science wasn't a linear one in the way most people would normally see things. 
Prior to February 2021 I didn't even know that a Data Scientist was a real job.  At first it sounds like the name of a villain from a comic book series that Superman 
or Batman have to go out and defeat. But as I decided to look more into what a Data Scientist was it started to appeal to me. I would read article after article 
that there was an ever growing need for data scientists in the tech world and beyond. One of the first things that pops up on google is a very simple description 
on what a data scientist does and goes like,
“A data scientist's role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans 
for companies and other organizations.”(From mastersindatascience.org)
I thought to myself, “I have been great with math for most of my life and that few times I have ever done anything that had to do with statistics it was just as easy as 
cutting through the smoothest piece of better that had ever been crafted here on this earth. The only thing I had little to no experience in was computer science. But with 
everyone needing it right now I thought it is best to learn what I can and use it rather than be without and need it and not be able to perform. 
Now when I started looking into the beyond with what data science can do I saw that a path I wanted to join years ago was also in need of data scientists and that this could 
be my foot in the door to start the long walk of this path. The path of working in the financial institutions with hedge funds, wall streets or a small traders group. 

## The Start
Once I got the idea of being a Data Scientist in my head I pretty much started my journey of trying to become one and get to my end game.

## My Education
My educational background is one that has been focused on math. In highschool I was put in the AP program for calculus for both versions they had in calculus. When just 
doing the derivations and integrations of functions became something I looked forward to doing I knew one hundred percent my future had to be math based. I always 
performed  “well” in math but was never sure about it. At my first college I decided to be a math major. Since it was a small school that focused more on preparing students 
to become nurses the group of people who were math majors were small. Most of my math classes would at most have10 people in them with only 7 of them being math majors. 
From there I realized I needed a different school to further my exploration with math and its broad range of applications. I then decided to transfer to the State University 
of New York of Stony Brook University. My decision was fully made after seeing at that time that they had the third highest applied mathematics and statistics program in the 
entire country's collegiate system. Once there I experienced elements and different aspects of math that I didn’t know of. Time series analysis, financial mathematics, 
probability and so on and so on. I eventually graduated with my bachelors in applied mathematics and statistics and was an achievement that still makes me smile to this day
when I think of it. With all this math knowledge that has been sucked up throughout the years I beleive I can apply to the data science world and hopefully allow my journey 
to have far less hiccups along this possible bumpy road.

## How Did I Start This Journey?
I started this journey with the idea of becoming a data scientist but ideas that are unused don’t impact the world. I needed to become a data scientist so I had to see how do 
I actually do it. Do I watch some videos and learn what their daily tasks are and repeat and it therefore makes me one? Do I just say I am one and just hope that the label 
sticks? These thoughts weren’t going to work so I needed my stepping stone. I had thought of graduate school but saw the process of applying and taking the gre and getting 
all the necessary documents to be one of countless logistical nightmare and I was thinking that I wouldn’t have the time to get everything ready for most graduate schools 
application deadlines. Around this time my friend who worked at a very large company was telling me that a person who hadn’t gone to 
college was his new trainee. He was confused because the expectations for the output of the job were so high and required tons of experience and he was trying to figure 
out why his company would hire a young non college graduate. He was told by his trainee that he had just finished a coding boot camp for software engineering.After that I 
decided to look up what coding boot camps were. My friend who I will continue to keep nameless told me his trainee went to Flatiron. I looked more into Flatiron and realized 
that same day I had walked past their NYC campus earlier in the week so a bit of kismat came about. The more and more I read about Flatiron the more I thought I could fit in 
and help me jump start my path with data science since I saw one of their boot camps was just data science.  I sent in my application and hoped for the best. Hearing nothing for
months worried me because I was thinking that this was supposed to be my start to Dante’s idea of Paradiso. Finally I got the call to schedule my interview and I prepared 
countless talking points to bring up. I got a call around a week later to say I got in and in a flash It brought me here today. 

## What coming? 
Countless projects will made, many relationships formed, and I hope in the end I will be worthy of being called a Data Scientist.
